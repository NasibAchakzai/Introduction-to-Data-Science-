# Introduction-to-Data-Science-
Introduction to Data Science 
Data Science is a combination of multiple disciplines that uses statistics, data analysis, and machine learning to analyze data and to extract knowledge and insights from it.
Python Basic Syntax 
## Python Basic Syntax
This is a basic Python program that uses the print() function to output the message "Hello, world!" to the console. It's often used as a simple starting point when learning a new programming language.
#
print("Naeesb Ullah!")
## Variables and data types
This code demonstrates how to define variables in Python and assign them different data types. The name variable is a string, the age variable is an integer, the is_male variable is a boolean, and the height variable is a float.
#
This code defines two variables A and B with values 2 and 3 respectively. Then, it performs an addition operation using the + operator on these two variables and prints the result of the addition operation to the console. In this case, the result of the addition operation is 8, so the output of the code will be 5

 A=2 
B=3
 print(A+B) = 5
 ## Functions
Functions in Python are a way to group a set of related statements together that perform a specific task. Functions make the code more modular, easier to read, and reusable.

In Python, you can define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and the parameters (if any) in parentheses. The function body is indented after a colon and contains the code that is executed when the function is called.

Here is an example of a simple function that takes two parameters x and y, adds them 
#
def add(x, y):
    result = x + y
    return result
sum = add(2, 3)
print(sum)  
# 
Output: 5
## There are several data types
Numeric types: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.
Integers are whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) without a decimal point, such as 42 or -10.
Floating-point numbers (also called floats) are decimal numbers, such as 3.14 or -0.5.
Complex numbers are represented as a sum of a real number and an imaginary number, such as 1 + 2j.
Boolean type: This type represents the truth values True and False.

Sequence types: These are ordered collections of elements:

Lists: mutable ordered sequence of elements enclosed in square brackets [].
Tuples: immutable ordered sequence of elements enclosed in parenthesis ().
Range: immutable sequence of numbers, used to generate a sequence of numbers.
Strings: immutable sequence of characters, enclosed in either single or double quotes.
Mapping types: These are collections of key-value pairs:
Dictionaries: mutable key-value mapping enclosed in curly braces {}.
Set types: These are collections of unique elements:
Sets: mutable unordered collection of unique elements enclosed in curly braces {}.
data types include:
 #### Numeric types:
x = 42        # int
y = 3.14      # float
z = 1 + 2j    # complex

#### Boolean type:
is_true = True
is_false = False

#### List type
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'four', 5.0]

#### Tuple type
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'four', 5.0)

#### Dictionary type
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

#### Set type
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Python also provides a variety of built-in functions and methods for working with these data types, such as len(), append(), remove(), and many more.






bool (True or False)
Sequence types:

list (mutable ordered sequence of elements)
tuple (immutable ordered sequence of elements)
range (immutable sequence of numbers)
str (immutable sequence of characters)
bytes (immutable sequence of bytes)
bytearray (mutable sequence of bytes)
Mapping types:

dict (mutable key-value mapping)
Set types:

set (mutable unordered collection of unique elements)
## conditional statements
 conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false. The most common conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.
 ####
a=8

if(a %2 ==0):
    print("this even number")
else:
        print("this Odd number")
## loop
loop is used to iterate over a sequence or other iterable object and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. The basic syntax of a for loop in Python is as follows:
#
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
  ## CSV files
   you can work with CSV (Comma Separated Values) files using the csv module. This module provides functionality to read and write CSV files in various formats including comma-separated values, tab-separated values, and other delimiter-separated values.

To read a CSV file in Python, you can use the csv.reader() function. This function takes a file object as input and returns a reader object which can be used to iterate over the rows in the CSV file. Here's an example:
####
import csv

with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
# NumPay

Numpy is the fundamental package for numeric computing with Python. It provides powerful ways to create, store, and/or manipulate data, which makes it able to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases. This is also the foundation that Pandas is built on, which is a high-performance data-centric package that we will learn later in the course.

In this lecture, we will talk about creating array with certain data types, manipulating array, selecting elements from arrays, and loading dataset into array. Such functions are useful for manipulating data and understanding the functionalities of other common Python data packages.
## Import
when we want to utilize a library in our Python code, we use the "import" keyword. In the case of the widely used numerical computing library "NumPy," it is conventionally abbreviated as "np" in Python code. Therefore, we can refer to NumPy as "np" after importing it.
###
import numpy as np
##
import math
##
# Array Creation
NumPy is a powerful numerical computing library for Python that provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical operations on them. The np.array() function is a NumPy function that creates a new array object from a given list or array-like object. In this case, it creates a NumPy array with the values [1, 2, 3]. The resulting array is assigned to the variable a for further use in the code.
 ####
 a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
 ####
 print(a)
####
[1 2 3]
####
In NumPy, arrays can have one or more dimensions, which are also known as axes. The ndim attribute is a property of NumPy arrays that returns the number of dimensions of the array.
#####
print(a.ndim)
####
1
#####
a = np.array([[1,2,3],[1,2,3]])
####
print(a)
####
We can print the number of dimensions of a list using the ndim attribute
####
print(a.ndim)
####
The resulting array b is a two-dimensional array with shape (2, 3), meaning it has 2 rows and 3 columns, and contains the values from the list of lists provided. This can be visualized as a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns, where the first row contains the values [1, 2, 3] and the second row contains the values [4, 5, 6].
####
b = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
####
 We can print out the length of each dimension by calling the shape attribute, which returns a tuple
####
b.shape
####
(2, 3)
####
We can also check the type of items in the array
####
a.dtype
####
Besides integers, floats are also accepted in numpy arrays
####
c = np.array([2.2, 5, 1.1])
####
c.dtype.name
####
'float64'
####
#### Note that numpy automatically converts integers, like 5, up to floats, since there is no loss of prescision.
#### Numpy will try and give you the best data type format possible to keep your data types homogeneous, which
#### means all the same, in the array
#### Sometimes we know the shape of an array that we want to create, but not what we want to be in it. numpy
#### offers several functions to create arrays with initial placeholders, such as zero's or one's.
#### Lets create two arrays, both the same shape but with different filler values
d = np.zeros((3,4,4))
####
#### Let's break down the code:

np.zeros(): This is a NumPy function that creates a new array object with a given shape and initializes all the elements to 0.

(3, 4, 4): This is a tuple specifying the shape of the array to be created. The tuple contains three integer values: 3, 4, and 4, representing the number of elements in each dimension of the array.

d = np.zeros(...): This assigns the created array to the variable d for further use in the code.

The resulting array d is a three-dimensional array with shape (3, 4, 4), meaning it has 3 slices, each with 4 rows and 4 columns, and all elements are initialized to 0. This can be visualized as a cube with 3 slices, each slice containing 4 rows and 4 columns, and all elements initialized to 0.

Note that the np.zeros() function can be used to create arrays of any dimension and shape, and the elements are initialized to 0 by default.
####
print(d)
####
####
[[[0. 0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0. 0.]]

 [[0. 0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0. 0.]]

 [[0. 0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0. 0.]]]
#### 
print(d.ndim)
####
3
#####
e = np.ones((2,3))
####
print(e)
####
[[[0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0.]]

 [[0. 0. 0.]
  [0. 0. 0.]]]
[[1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]]
 #####
  We can also generate an array with random numbers
  ####
np.random.rand(2)
####
#### You'll see zeros, ones, and rand used quite often to create example arrays, especially in stack overflow
#### posts and other forums.
#### We can also create a sequence of numbers in an array with the arrange() function. The fist argument is the
#### starting bound and the second argument is the ending bound, and the third argument is the difference between
#### each consecutive numbers
####
import numpy as np
####
#### Let's create an array of every even number from ten (inclusive) to fifty (exclusive)
####
f = np.arange(1,15,.6)
####
f.ndim
####
#### if we want to generate a sequence of floats, we can use the linspace() function. In this function the third
#### argument isn't the difference between two numbers, but the total number of items you want to generate
#### 15 numbers from 0 (inclusive) to 2 (inclusive)
#####
np.linspace( 0, 2, 15 ) 
#####
#### We can do many things on arrays, such as mathematical manipulation (addition, subtraction, square,
#### exponents) as well as use boolean arrays, which are binary values. We can also do matrix manipulation such
#### as product, transpose, inverse, and so forth.
#### Arithmetic operators on array apply elementwise.
####
 Let's create a couple of arrays
 ####
a = np.array([10,20,30,40])
####
b = np.array([1, 2, 3,4])
####

 Now let's look at a minus b
 #####
c = a-b
#####
print(c)
#####

 And let's look at a times b
 ####
d = a*b
#####
print(d)
#####
[ 9 18 27 36]
######
[ 10  40  90 160]
#####
#### With arithmetic manipulation, we can convert current data to the way we want it to be. Here's a real-world
#### problem I face - I moved down to the United States about 6 years ago from Canada. In Canada we use celcius
#### for temperatures, and my wife still hasn't converted to the US system which uses farenheit. With numpy I 
#### could easily convert a number of farenheit values, say the weather forecase, to ceclius

#### Let's create an array of typical Ann Arbor winter farenheit values
#### farenheit = np.array([0,-10,-5,-15,0])

##### And the formula for conversion is ((°F − 32) × 5/9 = °C)
###### celcius = (farenheit - 31) * (5/9)
####

##### Great, so now she knows it's a little chilly outside but not so bad.
##### Another useful and important manipulation is the boolean array. We can apply an operator on an array, and a
##### boolean array will be returned for any element in the original, with True being emitted if it meets the condition and False oetherwise.
##### For instance, if we want to get a boolean array to check celcius degrees that are greater than -20 degrees
#### celcius > -20

#### Here's another example, we could use the modulus operator to check numbers in an array to see if they are even. Recall that modulus does division but throws away #### everything but the remainder (decimal) portion)
#### celcius%2 == 0
####
#### Besides elementwise manipulation, it is important to know that numpy supports matrix manipulation. Let's
#### look at matrix product. if we want to do elementwise product, we use the "*" sign
####
A = np.array([[1,1],[0,1]])
#####
B = np.array([[2,0],[3,4]])
#####
print(A*B)
####
[[2 0]
 [0 4]]
### # if we want to do matrix product, we use the "@" sign or use the dot function
print(A@B)
np.dot(A,B)

[[5 4]
 [3 4]]
array([[5, 4],
       [3, 4]])

#### You don't have to worry about complex matrix operations for this course, but it's important to know that
#### numpy is the underpinning of scientific computing libraries in python, and that it is capable of doing both
#### element-wise operations (the asterix) as well as matrix-level operations (the @ sign). There's more on this
#### in a subsequent course.
#### A few more linear algebra concepts are worth layering in here. You might recall that the product of two
#### matrices is only plausible when the inner dimensions of the two matrices are the same. The dimensions refer
#### to the number of elements both horizontally and vertically in the rendered matricies you've seen here. We
#### can use numpy to quickly see the shape of a matrix:

A.shape
#### When manipulating arrays of different types, the type of the resulting array will correspond to 
#### the more general of the two types. This is called upcasting.

#### Let's create an array of integers
array1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
####
print(array1.dtype)

#### Now let's create an array of floats
array2 = np.array([[7.1, 8.2, 9.1], [10.4, 11.2, 12.3]])
####
print(array2.dtype)
#### Integers (int) are whole numbers only, and Floating point numbers (float) can have a whole number portion
#### and a decimal portion. The 64 in this example refers to the number of bits that the operating system is
#### reserving to represent the number, which determines the size (or precision) of the numbers that can be
#### represented.
#### Let's do an addition for the two arrays
#### array3=array1+array2
#### print(array3)
#### print(array3.dtype)
#### Notice how the items in the resulting array have been upcast into floating point numbers
#### Numpy arrays have many interesting aggregation functions on them, such as  sum(), max(), min(), and mean()
print(array3.sum())
####
print(array3.max())
####
print(array3.min())
####
print(array3.mean())
####
#### For two dimensional arrays, we can do the same thing for each row or column
#### let's create an array with 17 elements, ranging from 1 to 15, 
#### with a dimension of 4X4
b = np.arange(1,17,1).reshape(4,4)
####
print(b)
####
[[ 1  2  3  4]
 [ 5  6  7  8]
 [ 9 10 11 12]
 [13 14 15 16]]
 ####
 #### Now, we often think about two dimensional arrays being made up of rows and columns, but you can also think
##### of these arrays as just a giant ordered list of numbers, and the *shape* of the array, the number of rows
##### and columns, is just an abstraction that we have for a particular purpose. Actually, this is exactly how
##### basic images are stored in computer environments.

##### Let's take a look at an example and see how numpy comes into play.
##### For this demonstration I'll use the python imaging library (PIL) and a function to display images in the
##### Jupyter notebook

from PIL import Image
####
from IPython.display import display

#### And let's just look at the image I'm talking about
im1 = Image.open('../chris.tiff')
#### display(im)
#### Now, we can conver this PIL image to a numpy array
array=np.array(im1)
####
print(array.shape)
####
array.ndim
####
(200, 200)
####
2
#### Here we see that we have a 200x200 array and that the values are all uint8. The uint means that they are
#### unsigned integers (so no negative numbers) and the 8 means 8 bits per byte. This means that each value can
#### be up to 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2=256 in size (well, actually 255, because we start at zero). For black and white
#### images black is stored as 0 and white is stored as 255. So if we just wanted to invert this image we could
#### use the numpy array to do so

#### Let's create an array the same shape
mask=np.full(array.shape,255)
####
display(Image.fromarray(mask))
#### Now let's subtract that from the modified array
modified_array=array-mask

#### And lets convert all of the negative values to positive values
modified_array=modified_array*-1

#### And as a last step, let's tell numpy to set the value of the datatype correctly
####
modified_array=modified_array.astype(np.uint8)
####
modified_array.shape

#### And lastly, lets display this new array. We do this by using the fromarray() function in the python
#### imaging library to convert the numpy array into an object jupyter can render
display(Image.fromarray(modified_array))
#### Cool. Ok, remember how I started this by talking about how we could just think of this as a giant array
#### of bytes, and that the shape was an abstraction? Well, we could just decide to reshape the array and still
#### try and render it. PIL is interpreting the individual rows as lines, so we can change the number of lines
#### and columns if we want to. What do you think that would look like?
reshaped=np.reshape(modified_array,(100,400))
####
print(reshaped.shape)
####
display(Image.fromarray(reshaped))
# Indexing, Slicing and Iterating
Indexing, slicing and iterating are extremely important for data manipulation and analysis because these techinques allow us to select data based on conditions, and copy or update data.
#### First we are going to look at integer indexing. A one-dimensional array, works in similar ways as a list -
#### To get an element in a one-dimensional array, we simply use the offset index.
a = np.array([1,3,5,7])
####
a[2]
#### For multidimensional array, we need to use integer array indexing, let's create a new multidimensional array
a = np.array([[1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
#### if we want to select one certain element, we can do so by entering the index, which is comprised of two
#### integers the first being the row, and the second the column
a[1,1] #### remember in python we start at 0!
####
4
#### if we want to get multiple elements 
#### for example, 1, 4, and 6 and put them into a one-dimensional array
#### we can enter the indices directly into an array function
np.array([a[0, 0], a[1, 1], a[2, 1]])
####
array([1, 4, 6])
# Boolean Indexing
#### Boolean indexing allows us to select arbitrary elements based on conditions. For example, in the matrix we
#### just talked about we want to find elements that are greater than 5 so we set up a conditon a >5 
print(a >5)
#### This returns a boolean array showing that if the value at the corresponding index is greater than 5
[[False False]
 [False False]
 [False  True]]
 ####
 #### We can then place this array of booleans like a mask over the original array to return a one-dimensional 
 ####array relating to the true values.
print(a[a>5])
####
[6]
# Slicing
#### Slicing is a way to create a sub-array based on the original array. For one-dimensional arrays, slicing 
#### works in similar ways to a list. To slice, we use the : sign. For instance, if we put :3 in the indexing
#### brackets, we get elements from index 0 to index 3 (excluding index 3)
a = np.array([0,1,2,3,4,5])
print(a[:3])
[0 1 2]
#### By putting 2:4 in the bracket, we get elements from index 2 to index 4 (excluding index 4)
print(a[2:4])
####
[2 3]
#### For multi-dimensional arrays, it works similarly, lets see an example
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])

#### First, if we put one argument in the array, for example a[:2] then we would get all the elements from the 
#### first (0th) and second row (1th)
a[:2]
#### If we add another argument to the array, for example a[:2, 1:3], we get the first two rows but then the
#### second and third column values only
a[:2, 1:3]
#### So, in multidimensional arrays, the first argument is for selecting rows, and the second argument is for 
#### selecting columns
#### It is important to realize that a slice of an array is a view into the same data. This is called passing by
#### reference. So modifying the sub array will consequently modify the original array

#### Here I'll change the element at position [0, 0], which is 2, to 50, then we can see that the value in the
#### original array is changed to 50 as well

sub_array = a[:2, 1:3]
####
print("sub array index [0,0] value before change:", sub_array[0,0])
####
sub_array[0,0] = 50
####
print("sub array index [0,0] value after change:", sub_array[0,0])
####
print("original array index [0,1] value after change:", a[0,1])

#### Trying Numpy with Datasets
#### Now that we have learned the essentials of Numpy let's use it on a couple of datasets
#### Here we have a very popular dataset on wine quality, and we are going to only look at red wines. The data
#### fields include: fixed acidity, volatile aciditycitric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide,
#### total sulfur dioxidedensity, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality
#### To load a dataset in Numpy, we can use the genfromtxt() function. We can specify data file name, delimiter
#### (which is optional but often used), and number of rows to skip if we have a header row, hence it is 1 here

#### The genfromtxt() function has a parameter called dtype for specifying data types of each column this
#### parameter is optional. Without specifying the types, all types will be casted the same to the more
#### general/precise type
wines = np.genfromtxt("datasets/winequality-red.csv", delimiter=";", skip_header=True)

graduate_admission.shape
#### We can retrieve a column from the array using the column's name for example, let's get the CGPA column and
#### only the first five values.
graduate_admission['CGPA'][0:5]
array([9.65, 8.87, 8.  , 8.67, 8.21])
#### Since the GPA in the dataset range from 1 to 10, and in the US it's more common to use a scale of up to 4,
#### a common task might be to convert the GPA by dividing by 10 and then multiplying by 4
graduate_admission['CGPA'] = graduate_admission['CGPA'] /10 *4
graduate_admission['CGPA'][0:20] #let's get 20 values
#### Recall boolean masking. We can use this to find out how many students have had research experience by
#### creating a boolean mask and passing it to the array indexing operator
len(graduate_admission[graduate_admission['Research'] == 1])
#### Since we have the data field chance of admission, which ranges from 0 to 1, we can try to see if students
#### with high chance of admission (>0.8) on average have higher GRE score than those with lower chance of
#### admission (<0.4)

#### So first we use boolean masking to pull out only those students we are interested in based on their chance
#### of admission, then we pull out only their GPA scores, then we print the mean values.
print(graduate_admission[graduate_admission['Chance_of_Admit'] > 0.8]['GRE_Score'].mean())
print(graduate_admission[graduate_admission['Chance_of_Admit'] < 0.4]['GRE_Score'].mean())
#### Take a moment to reflect here, do you understand what is happening in these calls?

#### When we do the boolean masking we are left with an array with tuples in it still, and numpy holds underneath
#### this a list of the columns we specified and their name and indexes
graduate_admission[graduate_admission['Chance_of_Admit'] > 0.8]
#### Let's also do this with GPA
print(graduate_admission[graduate_admission['Chance_of_Admit'] > 0.8]['CGPA'].mean())
print(graduate_admission[graduate_admission['Chance_of_Admit'] < 0.4]['CGPA'].mean())
#### Hrm, well, I guess one could have expected this. The GPA and GRE for students who have a higher chance of
#### being admitted, at least based on our cursory look here, seems to be higher.
## Pandas
Pandas is an open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis, providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

Pandas is commonly used for working with structured data, such as tabular data, and offers functionalities for data cleaning, preprocessing, filtering, merging, and analysis, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation tasks in Python.
##
The main data structures provided by Pandas are
##
DataFrame: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to a table or a spreadsheet. It consists of rows and columns, where each column can hold different data types (numeric, string, datetime, etc.). DataFrames are useful for storing and manipulating structured data. They offer functionalities for indexing, selecting, filtering, merging, reshaping, and aggregating data.

Series: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type. It is similar to a column in a DataFrame or a single column of data. Series objects are useful for performing computations and operations on individual columns or data sequences. They also support indexing and slicing operations.

These data structures provide powerful capabilities for handling and analyzing data in a tabular format, allowing users to perform various data manipulation tasks efficiently.
### DataFrame Example:
import pandas as pd

### Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Emma', 'Peter', 'Lisa'],
        'Age': [28, 32, 25, 30],
        'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris', 'Sydney']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df)
###    Name  Age      City
0  John   28  New York
1  Emma   32    London
2 Peter   25     Paris
3  Lisa   30    Sydney
### Series Example:
import pandas as pd

### Creating a Series from a list
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
s = pd.Series(data)

print(s)
### 0    10
1    20
2    30
3    40
4    50
dtype: int64
## How to use API 
Using an API typically involves sending HTTP requests to a specific URL endpoint and receiving a response in a specified format, such as JSON or XML. Here are the basic steps to use an API
##
import pandas as pd
import requests
###
 Pandas provides powerful data manipulation and analysis tools, while Requests allows you to make HTTP requests to APIs. Here's an example that combines both libraries to fetch data from an API and process it using Pandas
###
response = requests.get('https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated?api_key=8265bd1679663a7ea12ac168da84d2e8&language=en-US&page=1')
###
It fetches the top-rated movies using the specified API key, language, and page parameters.
###
tem_dat=pd.DataFrame([response.json])
the JSON response from the API endpoint you provided contains multiple movie objects under the "results" key. If you want to create a DataFrame with each movie as a separate row, you can directly pass data['results'] to the pd.DataFrame() function without wrapping it in a list
###
for re in range(10):
